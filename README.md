Dead by daylight Randomizer
How to use it.

Repl.it:
Run the run command and it should work. (link at the bottom)

Download:
Just run the start.bat file and it should begin to randomize. If it doesnt and gives you some sort of error, make sure you have downloaded python 3.8.2 installed.

Note this was made when the newest killer was the executioner so newer killers may be missing. I will try to update it as fast as possible. Current patch at the time of making this is 4.0.2.
